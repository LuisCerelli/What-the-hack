    "En este notebook, repasarás los conceptos de tokens y chunking. En el notebook anterior (`CH-03-A-Grounding`), pudimos proporcionar algo de contexto adicional para fundamentar el modelo. ¿Existe un límite para la cantidad de contexto adicional que podemos proporcionar al modelo? Desafortunadamente, la respuesta es sí. Existe un límite para la cantidad de tokens permitidos en la entrada y la salida combinadas según el modelo que se esté utilizando.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entonces, ¿qué son los tokens? Los tokens son una representación de cómo los modelos de Azure OpenAI procesan el texto. Son palabras o simplemente fragmentos de caracteres. Veamos el número total de tokens en la respuesta que obtuvimos del primer notebook del Desafío 3. Hay muchas formas de calcular tokens. En este notebook, echaremos un vistazo a la biblioteca `tiktoken` para contar los tokens."
